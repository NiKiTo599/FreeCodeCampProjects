        Alexandre Dumas, was a French writer. His works have
        been translated into many languages, and he is one of the most widely
        read French authors. Many of his historical novels of high adventure
        were originally published as serials, including The Count of Monte
        Cristo, The Three Musketeers, Twenty Years After, and The Vicomte of
        Bragelonne: Ten Years Later. His novels have been adapted since the
        early twentieth century for nearly 200 films. Dumas' last novel, The
        Knight of Sainte-Hermine, unfinished at his death, was completed by
        scholar Claude Schopp and published in 2005. It was published in
        English in 2008 as The Last Cavalier. Prolific in several genres, Dumas
        began his career by writing plays, which were successfully produced from
        the first. He also wrote numerous magazine articles and travel books;
        his published works totalled 100,000 pages. In the 1840s, Dumas
        founded the Théâtre Historique in Paris. His father, General
        Thomas-Alexandre Dumas Davy de la Pailleterie, was born in the French
        colony of Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti) to Alexandre Antoine Davy
        de la Pailleterie, a French nobleman, and Marie-Cessette Dumas, a black
        slave. At age 14 Thomas-Alexandre was taken by his father to
        France, where he was educated in a military academy and entered the
        military for what became an illustrious career. Dumas' father's
        aristocratic rank helped young Alexandre acquire work with
        Louis-Philippe, Duke of Orléans, then as a writer, finding early
        success. Decades later, after the election of Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte
        in 1851, Dumas fell from favour and left France for Belgium, where he
        stayed for several years, then moved to Russia for a few years before
        going to Italy. In 1861, he founded and published the newspaper
        L'Indépendent, which supported Italian unification, before returning to
        Paris in 1864. Though married, in the tradition of Frenchmen of higher
        social class, Dumas had numerous affairs (allegedly as many as forty).
        In his lifetime, he was known to have at least four illegitimate
        children, although twentieth-century scholars found that Dumas fathered
        three other children out of wedlock. He acknowledged and assisted his
        son, Alexandre Dumas, to become a successful novelist and playwright.
        They are known as Alexandre Dumas père ('father') and Alexandre Dumas
        fils ('son'). Among his affairs, in 1866, Dumas had one with Adah Isaacs
        Menken, an American actress then less than half his age and at the
        height of her career. The English playwright Watts Phillips, who knew
        Dumas in his later life, described him as "the most generous,
        large-hearted being in the world. He also was the most delightfully
        amusing and egotistical creature on the face of the earth. His tongue
        was like a windmill – once set in motion, you never knew when he would
        stop, especially if the theme was himself."
